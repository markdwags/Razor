## 1.5.0.17 (03/17/19)

This version completely changes how Razor handles movement. Prior to this release, Razor would parse movement packets to determine your current X/Y/Z. During certain in-game actions, such as running when casting, this would sometimes cause you to desync. This is when the server thinks you're at a certain X/Y/Z and Razor thinks you're on another.

Razor will instead start a timer in the client that checks if the position has changed in client memory. When your position changes, it will send a message to notify Razor.

This way, Razor is no longer in the business of reading movement packets which should prevent you from ever desyncing.

### Razor

* Razor should no longer "desync" (usually experienced by people with lower pings).
* Crypt.dll has been cleaned up and optimized. You should notice Razor and UO start up quicker.
* If Razor has an issue verifying an animation for the filter dropdown, it will just load it by default.

### Macros

* The "Waiting.. Timeout" message when you're running a macro is easier to read.

### HotKeys

* If you use the "Add All Mobiles To Friends" it won't add the same person twice.

## 1.5.0.16 (03/04/19)

### Razor

* Changed the position of the Quit button on the Welcome screen.
* Removed packet and AVI recording since the feature has been sunset by modern applications and technology. If you need to watch or record packet videos, please use and older version. If you want to record videos, check out OBS.

### Options->Speech & Messages

* Added an Edit button to the Overhead message window to edit a message.
* Added an option to show [Friend] overhead if that mobile is on your friends list.

### Options->Targeting & Queues

* Fixed issue with Next/Prev Humanoid still targeting friends even when the checkbox was checked.

### Options->Additional Options

* Combined "Always show stealth steps" and "Count stealth steps" into one checkbox. The Now counting stealth steps. message has been removed since it didn't have any logic to only fire off when stealth was successful. Utilize the Overhead message feature if you want to see something overhead on a successful stealth.
* You can now customize the step message overhead.
* The Static Wall and label checkbox will now load/save properly.
  
### Skills

* Added an option to show skill/stat gains overhead.

## 1.5.0.15 (02/17/19)

### Razor

* Revamped the main Razor UI: As the feature set has grown, space has become limited. This initially led me down the road of expanding the window based on the top, but this started to prove to not be a good long term solution. I tried to keep the look and feel as close to Razor as possible.
* Removed window adjusting size based on the tab. It's now a static size.
* The "Options" tab now has sub-tabs with features broken into smaller categories.
* The "More Options" tab has been removed and condensed into "Options"
* The "Display/Counters" tab has been broken into two sub-tabs.
* The "Macros" tab has been broken into two sub-tabs, instead of that little button to expand the window.
* Numerous other slight adjustments.
* Revamp of the Welcome UI: Just to go along with the main UI revamp.
* More easily manage servers from the welcome UI
* Warning if your UO Client Directory and UO Data Directory don't match (often a source of issues for people)

### Macros

* Razor now will record and play prompt actions (ie: renaming runes, renaming runebooks, etc).
* Re-targeting a mobile on the DoubleClick action (ie: a horse) will work instead of having to re-record the double-click action.

### HotKeys

* Added a hotkey to add all the mobiles in range to your friends list.
* Added hotkeys for all pet commands (all follow, all kill, etc). This does the exact same thing as a standard macro recorded saying the command.
* The following targeting hotkeys exist in another version of Razor (1.0.14.10) that was updated in 2017. They've been added in this version.
    * Closest Criminal Monster
    * Closest Innocent Monster
    * Closest Murderer Humanoid
    * Closest Murderer Monster
    * Random Criminal Monster
    * Random Innocent Monster
    * Random Murderer Humanoid
    * Random Murderer Monster
    * Next Monster Target
    * Previous Monster Target
* The following targeting hotkeys are new to this version of Razor and did not exist in previous versions.
    * Closest Friendly Humanoid
    * Closest Friendly Monster
    * Closest Non-Friendly Humanoid
    * Closest Non-Friendly Monster
    * Random Friendly Humanoid
    * Random Friendly Monster
    * Random Non-Friendly Humanoid
    * Random Non-Friendly Monster
    * Closest Mobile
    * Random Mobile
  
### General

## 1.5.0.14 (01/16/19)

### Display/Counters

* Added a damage tracker feature that can be enabled/disabled via a hotkey that will track the following:
    * DPS (Damage Per Second)
    * Final DPS
    * Max DPS
    * Total Damage Dealt
    * Total Damage Taken
    * Max Single Damage Dealt (and to which mobile)
    * Max Single Damage Taken
    * Top 5 Damage Dealt By Name (ie: if you kill dragons for an hour, it will give you the total damage you dished out to all those dragons)
* When you stop the damage tracker, the stats above will be displayed in your client and journal.
* Updated the UO Title Bar to accept the following variables to display the tracked values above: {dps}, {maxdps}, {maxdamagedealt}, {maxdamagetaken}, {totaldamagedealt}, {totaldamagetaken}
* You can change the text in Razor's title bar just as you can with the UO title bar.


### General

* Added the ability to toggle Dragons and Drakes to use a different graphic. This will have the same effect as those who use the "artmods" to replace the large dragon graphic will a small dragon or some other graphic completely (Blackthrone is a popular one). In other words, only you will see the graphic change.
* Minor UI tweaks you may or may not notice.

### Hot Keys

* Added a hotkey that will only enable hotkeys (not toggle on/off).
* Added a hotkey that will only disable hotkeys (not toggle on/off).

### Maps

### Macros

* Added the ability to filter macros for easy searching.

### More Options

* You can now set individual hue colors for overhead messages.

## 1.5.0.13 (01/01/19)

### More Options

* Added option that will turn magic fields/walls into static tiles.
* Updated the attack name overhead feature to include the names of targets acquired via hotkeys.
* Added option to display a text target indicator over a newly acquired target.
* You can no longer open up multiple container label and overhead message windows.

### Macros

* Along with AbsoluteTarget variables, you can now create DoubleClick variables. NOTE: The goal of these macro variables is allow macros to be shared across multiple characters without requiring cloned copies of the macros.
* You can retarget to Lift and LiftByType actions (instead of having to record, re-lift new item, stop recording, delete old action)
* Pausing a macro when one isn't running will no longer cause a crash.
* Copy/pasted macro lines won't appear "linked" and will work across other macros.

### Maps

* The boat control will now let you set relative location. Right-click on the direction you're going to set the relative location.

## 1.5.0.12 (12/25/18)

### Razor

* Fixed the issue that was causing the "filter exceptions" popup
* The -ping command will display the correct value for the average
* Entering the wrong -command will no longer result in an error popup
* The previous version reverted Razor from using the updated visual style back to the older looking style due to a Windows patch last month (KB4459942). This has been fixed.

### Macros

* Fixed the issue with Absolute Target Variables not saving correctly in a macro

### Agents

* Like the Organizer Agent, you can no longer enter mulitple items into a Restock Agent
* Double-clicking on the list when viewing the Restock or Buy agents will popup the dialog to change the value (same behavior as clicking Edit)

## 1.5.0.11 (11/20/18)

### Razor

* Razor will check the value of UODataDir in your config before looking to the registry, making it now fully portable and able to handle computers with multiple versions of UO installed. This should fix missing images in the titlebar on counters for some people.
* Razor will try to be a little smarter when determining if it's offscreen and reset itself if it is.

### More Options

* If your container has a non-generic name (ie: holiday bags, special chests), you can set an alias so the container label will work on it.
* Added an option to automatically block trades
* Added an option to auto-accept party invites from friends
* You can set an min/max light level. Be sure you have your Light Filter unchecked before using this feature.

### Macros

* Double-click GumpResponse to check button ID
* Added Use Last Gump Response to macro options (ie: to update a macro using a runebook)

### Hot Keys

* Added a hotkey to interrupt spell casting (same effect as having a macro that picked up and equipped a pair of shoes).
* You can now capture data from large and small BOD deeds. The file will be saved in a .csv file (BODs.csv) in the root path of Razor.
  
## 1.5.0.10 (11/2/18)

### Razor

* Razor won't display extra systray icons
* Manually typing in a server name will save it correctly to the config
* Razor will correctly handle different sized maps
* Razor will import your macros, profiles and counter.xml from %AppData%\Razor when you run it the first time and the ImportProfilesAndMacros is set to true in the config.
* Razor will ignore if Window's font is zoomed (Windows 7 is 125% by default on some machines)
* -ping command will give a litle more detail

### Options

* You can now set the season in Razor that will display in the client. This will only change what you see.

### More Options

Overhead messages can be changed from Unicode to ASCII (more classic look)

### Macros

* Absolute Targets will now save in the profile instead of a separate file.
* Double-Clicking "If", Comments or "For Loops" should open the correct dialog
* Added ability to edit speech in macros
* Potential fix to WaitForGump action not working
* After you add a macro via the clipboard, it will desolate your clipboard.

### Agents

* Create a new agent IgnoreList, this allows you to add people to the list and all messages (regular, yell, whisper, emotes), except for spells, will be blocked from displaying in UO. This includes being blocked from going into Razor's internal SysMessage queue to be used for macros.

### Hot Keys

* Add UseOnce Container should no longer crash Razor
* Added Previous Target hotkeys to match the Next Target hotkeys
* Organizer and Restock hotkeys sorting has been changed to be more clear (this will require mapping those hotkeys)
* Instead of trying to figure out the monsters using mobtypes.txt, I changed the logic of targeting monsters to target anything that isn't human. This should prevent scenarios where it wouldn't target a monster using an animal model.

### Advanced

* The backup profile/macros button should now work if a certain folder is missing.

### Display/Counters

* {skill} timer will start when using skills directly in the client

## 1.5.0.9 (9/26/18)

## 1.5.0.0

### Razor

* Remove the auto-update feature check
* Remove PayPal button on Razor splash
* Popup windows for input should auto-focus and not require clicking in the text field first
* Convert much of the old .NET Hashtables and Arraylists to hopefully improve with performance
* Remove the use the DateTime.Now and use DateTime.UtcNow for the internal mechanism (DateTime.Now is 10 times slower than DateTime.UtcNow)
* Added -hue command
* Removed dependancy on InstallDir being in HKLM which should result in more people able to use Force Screen size. GetInstallDirectory now returns the folder the Razor.exe is running in.
* Removed all dependancy on the HMCU for the registry. All settings are in App.config and all Profiles and Macros are expected to be the sub folder of Razor.exe
* Additional UI adjustments

### General

* Completely remove the SmartCPU feature
* Add Clone Profile button to easily create a copy of an existing profile instead of having to use the default
* Add Checkbox to enable confirmation buttons on buttons that clear lists or delete things
* Delete confirmation when you deleting a profile
  
### Options

* Add {circle} to the Spell Format option to display, if you want, the circle the spell was casted from.

### Macros

* Copy macro to clipboard
* New button to create macro from clipboard
* Control-UP / Down to move macro line
* Rename macro from UI
* Double click macro action opens Edit dialog instead of having to right-click and Edit..
* Adding a macro to a group should not require typing in the group name each time
  
### Arms/Dress

* Add confirmation box on Clear List
  
### Agents

* Add confirmation box on all clear buttons (so tired of accidently clicking clear instead of clear hotbag)

### Hotkeys

* Filter by name to quickly find a hotkey

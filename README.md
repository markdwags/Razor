## Community Edition

The goal of this project is to revive and continue development and maintenance of the abandoned Razor project, focusing on "quality of life" improvements while attempting to keep the spirit and vision the original developers had for Razor and not driving down the path of advanced automation and scripting that's found in other UO assistants.

It's recommended that you use the [ClassicUO](https://github.com/andreakarasho/ClassicUO) client with this version of Razor, however it should will work with the original 5.x and 7.x clients though support for any bugs may be limited.

## Project History

Razor was originally designed by Bryan Pass, known as Zippy in the RunUO community as a replacement to UOAssist. Based on commit notes, active development on Razor ceased some time in the early 2010's with the source code being released in 2014.

 The code initially didn't include Crypt.dll and Loader.dll which are required to full integrate with the UO client. At some point, the code for those projects released into the same [GitHub repo](https://github.com/msturgill/razor).

 The original project was last updated May 2nd, 2014 and while over 50 forks exist on GitHub, none of them have been active or have made significant changes except for a few exceptions:

* [Jaedan](https://github.com/jaedan) (which this version is based on) who updated the project to compile and work in Visual Studio 2017 and made improvements to Crypt.dll that enabled this project to move forward.
* [SaschaKP](https://github.com/SaschaKP) who made several performance changes from generic to non-generic collections that I incorporated in the first release.

I based this version off of 1.4.0.3, which was simply version 1.0.13.13 updated from .NET 2.0 to .NET 4.0 available from [this repo](https://github.com/msturgill/razor). Another version of Razor exists (the 1.0.14.x versions) and is/was maintained by another private shard that make some enhancements, notable around targeting. This version of Razor has long since incorporated the majority of changes you can find in that version.

This project has been active since early April 2018 and for 10 months implemented many quality of life changes (see all the 1.5.0.x [release notes](http://www.uor-razor.com/#releasenotes) for details) and in February 2019 integration into [ClassicUO](https://github.com/andreakarasho/ClassicUO) was established (see all the 1.6 [release notes](https://github.com/markdwags/Razor/releases/) for details)

## Versions

All version of Razor don't use the Windows Registry or `%AppData%\Razor` to store configuration, macros and profiles. In other words, it's portable.

* **1.6.x.x** support both the standard client and [ClassicUO](https://github.com/andreakarasho/ClassicUO).
* **1.5.0.0** to **1.5.0.16** only support the standard Ultima Online client.
* **1.5.0.17** has major changes to how Razor determines player position to address Razor's "desync" issue and only supports the standard Ultima Online client.

## Razor Scripting Engine

Introduced in 1.6.3.x, Razor supports a command-based script language based on the lexer and parser by designed by [Jaedan](https://github.com/jaedan).

**NOTE:** This ***is not*** an implementation of the Steam or Razor Enhanced scripting languages or functionality into Razor. The scripting engine attempts to maintain existing Razor functionality while offering quality of life improvements over the existing macro system.
